=head1 NAME

App::Multigit - Run commands on a bunch of git repositories without having to
deal with git subrepositories.

=head1 PACKAGE VARS

=head2 %BEHAVIOUR

This holds configuration set by options passed to the C<mg> script itself.

Observe that C<mg [options] command [command-options]> will pass C<options> to
C<mg>, and C<command-options> to C<mg-command>. It is those C<options> that will
affect C<%BEHAVIOUR>.

Scripts may also therefore change C<%BEHAVIOUR> themselves, but it is probably
badly behaved to do so.

=head3 report_on_no_output

Defaults to true; this should be used by scripts to determine whether to bother
mentioning repositories that gave no output at all for the given task. If you
use C<App::Multigit::Repo::report>, this will be honoured by default.

Controlled by the C<MG_REPORT_ON_NO_OUTPUT> environment variable.

=head3 ignore_stdout

=head3 ignore_stderr

These default to false, and will black-hole these streams wherever we have
control to do so.

Controlled by the C<MG_IGNORE_{STDOUT,STDERR}> environment variables.

=head3 concurrent_processes

Number of processes to run in parallel. Defaults to 20.

Controlled by the C<MG_CONCURRENT_PROCESSES> environment variable.

=head3 skip_readonly

Do nothing to repositories that have C<readonly = 1> set in C<.mgconfig>.

Controlled by the C<MG_SKIP_READONLY> environment variable.

=head2 @SELECTED_REPOS

If this is not empty, it should contain paths to repositories. Relative paths
will be determined relative to L<C<<mg_root>>|/mg_root>.

Instead of using the C<.mgconfig>, the directories in here will be used as the
list of repositories on which to work.

Each repository's C<origin> remote will be interrogated. If this exists in the
C<.mgconfig> then it will be used as normal; otherwise, it will be treated as
though it had the default configuration.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These are not currently exported.

=head2 mgconfig

Returns C<.mgconfig>. This is a stub to be later configurable, but also
to stop me typoing it all the time.

=head2 mg_parent

Tries to find the closest directory with an C<mgconfig> in it. Dies if there is
no mgconfig here. Optionally accepts the directory to start with.

=head2 all_repositories

Returns a hashref of all repositories under C<mg_parent>.

The keys are the repository directories relative to C<mg_parent>, and the values
are the hashrefs from the config, if any.

=head2 selected_repositories

This returns the repository configuration as determined by
L<C<<@SELECTED_REPOS>>|/@SELECTED_REPOS>. Directories that exist in the main
config (L<all_repositories>) will have their configuration honoured, but unknown
directories will have default configuration.

=head2 each($command[, $ia_config])

For each configured repository, C<$command> will be run. Each command is run in
a separate process which C<chdir>s into the repository first. Optionally, the
C<$ia_config> hashref may be provided; this will be passed to
L<App::Multigit::Repo/run>.

It returns a convergent L<App::Multigit::Future> that represents all tasks. When
this Future completes, all tasks are complete.

=head4 Subref form

The most useful form is the subref form. The subref must return a Future; when
this Future completes, that repository's operations are done.

The convergent Future (C<$future> below) completes when all component Futures
(the return value of C<then>, below) have completed. Thus the script blocks at
the C<< $future->get >> until all repositories have reported completion.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run(\&do_a_thing)
            ->then($repo->curry::run(\&do_another_thing))
        ;
    });

    my @results = $future->get;

See C<examples/mg-branch> for a simple implementation of this.

The Future can complete with whatever you like, but be aware that C<run> returns
a hash-shaped list; see the docs for
L<run|App::Multigit::Repo/"run($command, [%data])">. This means it is often
useful for the very last thing in your subref to be a transformation - something
that extracts data from the C<%data> hash and turns it into a usefully-shaped
list.

The example C<examples/mg-closes> does this, whereas C<examples/mg-branch> uses
C<report>.

L<report|App::Multigit::Repo/"report(%data)"> in App::Multigit::Repo implements
a sensible directory-plus-output transformation for common usage.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run(\&do_a_thing)
            ->then($repo->curry::run(\&do_another_thing))
            ->then($repo->curry::report)
        ;
    });

The subref given to C<run> is passed the C<%data> hash from the previous
command. C<%data> is pre-prepared with blank values, so you don't have to check
for definedness to avoid warnings, keeping your subrefs nice and clean.

    sub do_a_thing {
        my ($repo_obj, %data) = @_;
        ...
    }

Thus you can chain them in any order.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run(\&do_another_thing)
            ->then($repo->curry::run(\&do_a_thing))
            ->then($repo->curry::report)
        ;
    });

Observe also that the interface to C<run> allows for the arrayref form as well:

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run([qw/git checkout master/])
            ->then($repo->curry::run(\&do_another_thing))
        ;
    });

A command may fail. In this case, the Future will fail, and if not handled, the
script will die - which is the default behaviour of Future. You can use
L<else|Future/else> to catch this and continue.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run([qw{git rebase origin/master}])
            ->else([qw{git rebase --abort])
            ->then($repo->curry::report)
        ;
    });

The failure is thrown in a manner that conforms to the expected Future fail
interface, i.e. there is an error message and an error code in there. Following
these is the C<%data> hash that is consistent to all invocations of C<run>. That
means that when you do C<else>, you should be aware that there will be two extra
parameters at the start of the argument list.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run([qw{git rebase origin/master}])
            ->else(sub {
                my ($message, $error, %data) = @_;
                ...
            })
            ->then($repo->curry::report)
        ;
    });

In the case that you don't care whether the command succeeds or fails, you can
use L<finally|App::Multigit::Repo/finally> to catch the failure and pretend it
wasn't actually a failure.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run([qw{git rebase origin/master}])
            ->finally($repo->curry::report)
        ;
    });

Despite the name, C<finally> does not have to be the final thing. Think
"finally" as in "try/catch/finally". In the following code, C<finally> simply
returns the C<%data> hash, because C<finally> transforms a failure into a
success and discards the error information.

    use curry;
    my $future = App::Multigit::each(sub {
        my $repo = shift;
        $repo
            ->run([qw{git rebase origin/master}])
            ->finally(sub { @_ })
            ->then(\&carry_on_camping)
            ->then($repo->curry::report)
        ;
    });

=head4 Arrayref form

In the arrayref form, the C<$command> is passed directly to C<run> in
L<App::Multigit::Repo|App::Multigit::Repo/"run($command, [%data])">.  The
Futures returned thus are collated and the list of return values is thus
collated.

Because L<run|App::Multigit::Repo/"run($command, [%data])"> completes a Future
with a hash-shaped list, the convergent Future that C<each> returns will be a
useless list of all flattened hashes. For this reason it is not actually very
much use to do this - but it is not completely useless, because all hashes are
the same size:

    my $future = App::Multigit::each([qw/git reset --hard HEAD/]);
    my @result = $future->get;

    my $natatime = List::MoreUtils::natatime(10, @result);

    while (my %data = $natatime->()) {
        say $data{stdout};
    }

However, the C<%data> hashes do not contain repository information; just the
output. It is expected that if repository information is required, the closure
form is used.

=head2 mg_each

This is the exported name of C<each>

    use App::Multigit qw/mg_each/;

=head2 mkconfig($workdir)

Scans C<$workdir> for git directories and registers each in C<.mgconfig>. If the
config file already exists it will be appended to; existing config will be
preserved where possible.

=head2 write_config

Write a .mgconfig configuration file.

=head2 clean_config

Checks the C<.mgconfig> for directories that don't exist and removes the associated repo section.

=head2 base_branch

Returns the branch that the base repository is on -the repository that contains
the C<.mgconfig> or equivalent.

The purpose of this is to switch the entire project onto a feature branch;
scripts can use this as the cue to work against a branch other than master.

This will die if the base repository is not on a branch, because if you've asked
for it, giving you a default will more likely be a hindrance than a help.

=head2 set_base_branch($branch)

Checks out the provided branch name on the parent repository. Beware of using a
branch name that already exists, because this will switch to that branch if it
does.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module could have been a lot simpler but I wanted it to be a foray into the
world of Futures.  Shout outs go to those cats in irc.freenode.net#perl who
basically architectured this for me.

=over

=item tm604 (TEAM) - for actually understanding Future architecture, and not
being mad at me.

=item LeoNerd (PEVANS) - also for not being irritated by my inane questions
about IO::Async and Future.
