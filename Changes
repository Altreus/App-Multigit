    - Removed -R from mg-init - seemed bad on several levels
    - Renamed --remove-missing to --remove-repos because ambiguity
    - Error handling when IO::Async::Process itself fails (actually in 0.13 but
      I forgot)
    - Replaced LWP::Simple with HTTP::Tiny

    - mg-init has learned new tricks
      * Clones missing repos
        * or removes them from config
      * Can remove repos rather than re-registering them
      * Accepts file parameter to initialise from
    - Underlying IO::Async::Process can be told not to chdir
    - init is now called mkconfig
    - Added clean_config function, which cleans the config
